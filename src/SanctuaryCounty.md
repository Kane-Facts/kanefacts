# Is Kane County a Sanctuary County?
In a word, yes.  As County Board Chair Corinne Pierog told the audience at a recent board meeting (as reported by the [Daily Herald](https://www.dailyherald.com/20240229/local-politics/pierog-sanctuary-status-for-kane-county-already-decided-by-state-law/)):
> "The Trust Act made 102 counties in the state of Illinois what you would consider a sanctuary county," Pierog told the raucous audience. "You are asking if I'm advocating Kane County be a sanctuary county? That was already done by a Republican governor. I cannot undo state law."

## Detailed Information

### Illinois Legislative Action
The TRUST Act passed the Illinois Senate on May 4, 2017 by a 31-21 vote.  It was passed by the Illinois House (with changes) on May 29, 2017 by a 62-49 vote.  The Senate voted to concur on May 31, 2017 by a vote of 37 to 17.  Governor Rauner signed the legislation on August 28, 2017.  During the consideration of the legislation, 1792 citizens filed witness slips with the General Assemby in favor of the law, while only 55 citizens were against it.  The full text of the Trust Act can be viewed directly from the [Illinois General Assembly](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/100/PDF/100-0463.pdf).

### What is a sanctuary city/county/state?
There is no official definition, but in general it means that the local area limits cooperation with federal agents in dealing with federal immigration laws.  As you saw from the text of the law above, Illinois limits only a very specific kind of cooperation - it does not prohibit all cooperation.  For more information about sanctuary cities/counties, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city) contains a lot of discussion.

### How does this relate to the bussed migrants?
It doesn't.  The current situation is that migrants are crossing the border and looking for federal agents.  When a migrant encounters a federal agent, they formally request asylum in the United States.  Once this happens, the migrant is assigned a case and a federal asylum hearing is scheduled.  While waiting for the asylum hearing, the migrant is legally allowed to reside anywhere within the United States, including Kane County.  There is nothing for federal or local law enforcement to do, so there is nothing to cooperate on.  The Illinois TRUST Act is completely irrelevant on this issue.
